# CONTENT WARNING SHADER MIRROR


This is a repository to make content warning shader available for modding. 
Most of the shaders are written using [Ampify Shader Editor](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/amplify-shader-editor-68570). 
They can still be modified by hand though.

The .asset files are [Amplify Shader Editor Functions](http://wiki.amplify.pt/index.php?title=Unity_Products:Amplify_Shader_Editor/Manual#Shader_Functions)
